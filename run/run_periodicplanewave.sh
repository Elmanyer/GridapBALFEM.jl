#  SNELLIUS ROME SIZING: 42 ranks x 4 GiB = 168 GiB = exactly 6/8 of a node.
#  Was 48 ranks, which billed 7/8 (memory fraction 6.86/8 rounds up). The rome node is
#  128 cores / 224 GiB divided into EIGHTHS, and the LARGER of the core/memory fraction
#  sets the bill -- at 4 GiB/rank memory always wins, so the cost-optimal count is 7k
#  ranks for tier k/8. See run/SNELLIUS_ROME_LAUNCH_CONFIGS.md.

# Memory: the rome node default (2 GB/core) was TESTED (2026-08) and the job was
# still OOM-killed. 4 GB/core is required, and is now MEASURED rather than
# argued: the 2026-08-30 small-domain runs peaked at 3633 MB/rank, so 3 GB/core
# would OOM as well. RSS rose over the first ~100 steps and then PLATEAUED --
# no per-step leak. See building_files/OPEN_ITEMS.md section 1.
#
# RANK COUNT HERE IS MEMORY-BOUND, NOT PHYSICS-BOUND. A rome node advertises
# 256 GB but SLURM can only allocate ~224 GB of it, so the old request of
# 64 ranks/node x 4 GB = 256 GB/node was REFUSED at submit time:
#   "Requested node configuration is not available"
# Cut to 48 ranks/node x 4 GB = 192 GB/node (128 -> 96 ranks over 2 node(s)),
# rather than spreading the old rank count over more nodes.
# Do NOT drop mem-per-cpu on the argument that the sysimage removes the
# per-rank compile: that argument was tested and refuted.
